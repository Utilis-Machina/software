# Software

This repo contains code and scripts supporting projects for [Utilis Machina](https://www.utilismachina.com/).

## Introduction

This repository includes code used for project demonstrations. The high level structure consists of:

- A folder per major software driver
- A `Demos` folder containing the code used on specific projects

Contributions should include unit tests and Github workflows to maintain functionality. It's also
recommended to provide a convenient isolated hardware test if possible.

## Projects

See [Lunar Wombats](Demos/README.md) for more information.
